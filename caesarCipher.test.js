// A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.

// Don’t forget to test wrapping from z to a.
// Don’t forget to test keeping the same case.
// Don’t forget to test punctuation!
// For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few smaller functions. 
// Don’t need to explicitly test every function you write, just the public ones. 
// So in this case you only need tests for the final caesarCipher function. 
// If works as expected can be sure that your smaller helper functions are doing what they’re supposed to.
